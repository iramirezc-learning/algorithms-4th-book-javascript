# Algorithms (4th Edition)

## Chapter 2. Sorting

### Key Concepts

#### Selection Sort

> Is simple to understand and serves as an introduction for sorting algorithms.
>
> A notorious disadvantage is:
>
> * Selection Sort takes the same time to sort an ordered array as if the array has all the keys randomly dispersed or all the keys to be equal.

#### Insertion Sort

> Is an excellent method for partially sorted arrays and is also a fine method for tiny arrays.

#### Steps to Compare two Sorting Algorithms

> * Implement and debug them
> * Analyze their basic properties
> * Formulate a hypothesis about comparative performance
> * Run experiments to validate the Hypothesis
