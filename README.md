## Note About My Exercises Solutions

:warning: _Do **NOT** copy any of my solutions, these are only for the future me. You should have attempted solving any of these exercises by your own at least for a couple of days before trying to look for a solution. My solutions can be **wrong**._

## Benchmarks
